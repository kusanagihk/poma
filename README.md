A micro framework for POJO creation, manipulation and transformation, no more troubles creating numerous POJO

Simply the framework creates a javascript like "object" for you, now you could dynamically add key-value pair attributes to the "pojo".
Manipulation of the "pojo" is easy and straightforward like how you do on a javascript "object". Lastly, transformation from "pojo" to a target type of Java Object is possible too, so now you could transform your good old "pojo" in java beans that suits for other frameworks to work on.
